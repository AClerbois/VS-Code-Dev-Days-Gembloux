# VS Code Dev Days 
 
The **VS Code Dev Days** event series is a global, in-person user group initiative coming this September. Our goal is to bring together developers, enthusiasts, and local communities to explore the power of Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot in agentic AI development.

These **in-person workshops** will be held worldwide in **September 2025**, lasting 2.5 to 3 hours, and are led by local tech communities.
